# Create a GitHub release

> **Audience:** contributors *working on* this repository. Not packaged — see `AGENTS.md` at the repository root.

Creating a release is what publishes to nuget.org: the `ci-cd` workflow runs its
`publish` job on `release: created`, packs, and pushes to
`https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json`. Pushing a package version is **permanent**
— nuget.org does not allow re-uploading a version, only unlisting it. Confirm
with the user before creating the release, and never create one from a red build.

## 1. Preconditions

```bash
git switch main && git pull --ff-only
git status --short          # must be empty
gh run list --limit 3       # ci-cd, codeql-analysis and linter green on HEAD
```

Stop and report if the tree is dirty, HEAD is not on `main`, or any workflow on
HEAD is failing or still running.

## 2. Determine the version

Versioning is GitVersion in ContinuousDelivery mode (`GitVersion.yml`) with
`commit-message-incrementing: Enabled`. **The version only advances when a
commit message since the last bump contains a `+semver:` trailer** — `+semver: fix`
or `+semver: patch`, `+semver: feature` or `+semver: minor`, `+semver: breaking`
or `+semver: major`. Without one the computed version stays where it is and the
release would republish an existing version number.

Read the version CI actually computed for HEAD rather than guessing:

```bash
RUN_ID=$(gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --branch=main --limit=1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
JOB_ID=$(gh run view "$RUN_ID" --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | select(.name == "set-version") | .databaseId')
gh run view "$RUN_ID" --log --job="$JOB_ID" | grep -E '"(majorMinorPatch|semVer)"'
```

Compare that to what is already released and tagged:

```bash
gh release list --limit 5
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -5
```

Tags are `vX.Y.Z` and are created automatically by the `tagging` job on pushes to
`main`, so the tag for this version usually exists already and may run ahead of
the last release. If the computed version is one that was already published to
NuGet, stop: the user needs a `+semver:` commit first.

## 3. Build the changelog

Take the range from the previously *released* tag (not merely the previous tag)
to the tag being released:

```bash
PREVIOUS=$(gh release list --limit 1 --json tagName --jq '.[0].tagName')
TARGET=v<version from step 2>
git log --no-merges --pretty='%s (%h)' "$PREVIOUS..$TARGET"
```

Group the subjects by conventional-commit type under these headings, dropping
the empty ones, and drop the `type(scope):` prefix from each line:

```markdown
### Features        <- feat
### Fixes           <- fix
### Changes         <- refactor, perf
### Documentation   <- docs
### Maintenance     <- chore, ci, build, test
```

Note any breaking change (`!` in the type, or a `+semver: breaking` trailer) in a
short paragraph at the top. End with the compare link:

```markdown
**Full changelog**: https://github.com/patmoreau/drifterapps-seeds-fluentscenario/compare/<PREVIOUS>...<TARGET>
```

Show the user the assembled notes and the target tag, and get an explicit yes
before the next step.

## 4. Create the release

The tag normally already exists. Create the release against it:

```bash
gh release create "$TARGET" --title "$TARGET" --notes-file <notes-file>
```

If the tag does not exist yet, add `--target main` so GitHub creates it from the
current `main` commit. Use `--latest` only when this is the newest version — it
is the default for the highest semver, so pass `--latest=false` when cutting a
patch for an older line.

## 5. Watch the publish

Creating the release triggers a fresh `ci-cd` run whose `publish` job pushes the
package. Watch that run, not the earlier push-triggered one:

```bash
RELEASE_RUN=$(gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml --event=release --limit=1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
gh run watch "$RELEASE_RUN" --exit-status --interval 15
gh run view "$RELEASE_RUN" --json jobs --jq '.jobs[] | "\(.name): \(.conclusion)"'
```

`publish` must report `success`. If it fails, read its log before retrying —
a failure *after* `dotnet nuget push` succeeded means the version is already on
nuget.org and must not be pushed again (the push uses `--skip-duplicate`, so a
re-run is safe but will not replace anything).

## 6. Verify on nuget.org

Indexing can take **up to an hour** — a successful `publish` job is the
authority that the version shipped, not this index. Both packages ship from this
repo:

```bash
for pkg in drifterapps.seeds.fluentscenario drifterapps.seeds.fluentscenario.fluentassertions; do
  echo "$pkg: $(curl -s "https://api.nuget.org/v3-flatcontainer/$pkg/index.json" | jq -r '.versions[-1]')"
done
```

Report the released version, both package versions now on nuget.org, and the
release URL. Do not sit polling this endpoint: check once, and when it still
shows the previous version, report the release as published on the strength of
the `publish` log (`Your package was pushed.`) and say indexing is pending, with
the command above for the user to re-check later. Never report the old version
as the result.

A symbols push logging `already exists at feed` is normal — nuget.org takes the
`.snupkg` with the main package, so the separate symbols push dedups.

## Never

- Create a release when CI on HEAD is red or still running.
- Publish a version that is already on nuget.org.
- Hand-edit the version in `Directory.Build.props` or a csproj — GitVersion owns it.
